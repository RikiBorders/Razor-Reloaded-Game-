# Razor-Reloaded-Game-
A side-scrolling shooter game developed in Python. This game features 6 unique and distinct levels, and 8 unique enemies including a final boss. 
All artwork and programming was done independently by me. Instructions on how to play can be found in the game's settings menu, and all stages are available for play
after clicking 'play'.

**Running the Game**
In order to run the game, Razor Reloaded.exe must be in the same directory as the sounds and sprites folders. After both folders and the exe are placed in the same directroy, the exe can be launched to play the game without a need for installation.


This game was developed in winter 2019. I privated the original repository as it was messy, and creating a new repo would be quicker and cleaner than re-vamping the old one. A full changelog can be found below (development notes I maintained while developing the game in 2019):



12/23/2019:
Create window, and player object. Player should be able to move up, down, left, and right.

Player should also be able to fire bullets by pressing and holding space. Special weapons and abilities will be bound to the mouse.
